> 📚 A complete archive of my BSc IT practicals, assignments, and personal programming practice — organized semester-wise and subject-wise.

Welcome to the **All-College** repository — a personal knowledge hub where I’ve documented everything I’ve learned and practiced throughout my **Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSc IT)** journey.
